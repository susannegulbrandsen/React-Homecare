# HomeCare App
Our application is a full-stack healthcare management system built as a project in Webprogrammering at OsloMet.
The application allows administrators, employees and patients to manage appointments, medications, and personal information using a role-based access model that controls what each user can see and do. We have built this with React + TypeScript on the frontend and .Net8 Web API on the backend.

FEATURES

Patients:
- Create, update, delete patient
- View medical and personal info
- Linked medications and appointments

Medications:
- Full CRUD
- Validation on required fields
- Linked to spesific patients

Appointments
- Full CRUD
- Different views for patient vs employee

Authentication and roles:
- JWT-based login
- Two roles: Patient andemployee
- Role-based UI and API access based on the role claim in the JWT

Security configuration (backend)
- CORS restricted to the known frontend origins, allowing only the HTTP methods GET, POST, PUT and DELETE and the headers Content-Type and Authorization (AllowCredentials unchanged).

- HTTPS redirection and HSTS enabled in non-Development environments, so production traffic is forced over HTTPS while local Development can still run over HTTP.

- JWT signing key removed from appsettings.json and no longer stored in the repository.

- Separate development JWT configuration in appsettings.Development.json with a clear “dev only” dummy key plus issuer and audience, so the project runs locally without extra setup.

- Strict JWT validation in Program.cs (issuer, audience, lifetime, signing key and claim handling) to ensure only valid tokens can access the API.

Notifications
- CRUD
- Functionality for employee and patient


Known issues to fix:
BUG: DateOfBirth field lacks validation and accepts dates later than today
Further recommended security hardening and future improvements are described in the project documentation
